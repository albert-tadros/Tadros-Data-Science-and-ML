# [Project 1: The impact of COVID19 on the NYC Public High School Enrollment](https://github.com/albert-tadros/NYC-High-School-Studnet-enrollment)
***This python data analysis project aims to investigate any change in the enrollment number of high school students in NYC public school during COVID19 pandemic. The data used for the analysis was secondary data sourced from [the New York State Education Department Data website](https://data.nysed.gov/). The analysis was implemented using Python on Jupyter notebooks. The following python's data analysis libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, were mainly used in the project.***

**Problem Statement**

Overall, college enrollments in the U.S. declined by 4% during the year 2020 due to the pandemic. Given that high school education is just as important as college education, the goal of this analysis is to gain insights on effect of the pandemic on the NYC public high school enrollment numbers during the first year of the pandemic (2020 and early 2021).

**Guiding Analysis Questions**

- Has public high school enrollment fallen like college enrollment?
- Do public high school enrollments vary by student ethnicity and gender in 2020?
- Do public high school enrollments vary between student of different economic advantage in 2020?
- What has been the trend of public high school enrollment before the pandemic?
- If an enrollment trend is recognized, can there be an explanation to change in the enrollment ?

# [Project 2: Maven Toyes Profit Margin](https://github.com/albert-tadros/Maven-Toyes-Profit-Margin-Project)

***This python data analysis project aims to improve the profit margin of the company Maven Toys using the company's products, sales, stores, and inventory data. The analysis was implemented using Python on Jupyter notebooks. The following python's data analysis libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, were mainly used in the project.***

**Question:** The executive at Maven Toys is interested in how they can strategically improve their margins. 

**Reframing the Question:** Analyzing the data, the goal was to determine: 

- Which products should Maven Toys focus on while utilizing what methods to improve overall sales margin. 
- Which products are of interest company wide.
- which products are of interest at individual stores.

**Executive Summary:** This project provides an analysis and strategic recommendations for improving sales margins at Maven Toys by analyzing company wide and individual store data to identify specific products that can improve sales margin and by association sales revenue. The project will also identify products that hinder sales margin through analysis of low sales revenue and products with long shelf lifes. The method of our analysis consists of calculating average cost, generated sale revenue, product margin, variable correlation and age of inventory.
